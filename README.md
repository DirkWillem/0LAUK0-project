This repository contains both the web application (written in TypeScript using Angular 2) and the web service (written in Go using a PostgreSQL database). The DDL of the service database [can be found on the wiki](https://github.com/DirkWillem/0LAUK0-project/wiki/DDL)

If you would ever want to continue this project using this software, feel free to message me
